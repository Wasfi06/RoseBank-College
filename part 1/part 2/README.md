## Changelog
### everything

 for part 1 I had 5 separate page links ,however, for part 2 I have changed it to 3. the 2 page links are enquiry and services and they are situated ,respectively, in the contact.html and about.html page links. i have done this to make my website more efficient by having less pages with the same amount of information as before. the website will slightly be changed but it shows all the requirements as before such as the enquiry page, it can be used as a contact page as well.
